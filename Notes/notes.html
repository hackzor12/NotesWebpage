  <ul>
    <li>b - bold </li>
    <li>em - italic </li>
    <li>img - images (no ending tag)</li>
    <li>h2 - heading 2</li>
    <li>br - in line break</li>
    <li>p - paragraph</li>

  <h2>Basics</h2>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Computers are stupid and they interpret everything literally</b></li>
      <li><em>A lot of this is review for me and I am taking the course for fun</em></li>
      <li>Inline elements like "&lt;b&gt;" can coexist with other text but block elements like "&lt;p&gt;" will exist seperately from the tags outside of itself.</li>
      <li><p><a href = "http://www.Udacity.com"> Udacity</a> is a great place to learn basic programming skills
      Remember to use href for links and src for images but don't sweat it. W3 Schools and other documentation are important tools for programmers because we don't
      always remember every fact rather large ideas and we know how to find the details we need when we need them.

<h2>Advanced</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Everything on a webpage is divided into a stucture of boxes.<br></li>
  <li>HTML contains the stucture and the content of a webpage but not the style<br></li>
  <li>The style of a webpage is contained in a CSS file and it interacts with the stucture to easily apply different styles to different boxes/divs/spans on a webpage<br></li>
  <li>CSS allows us to style webpages easily and avoid repitition and it is important not to write the CSS inline to help avoid repitition.<br></li>
  <li>The box model of every element on a webpage content > padding > margin > border<br></li>
  <li>Box-sizing allows the box to stay the same by adjusting the margin keeping the box at a constant size<br></li>
  <li>HTML and CSS should comply with standards for all common browsers<br></li>
